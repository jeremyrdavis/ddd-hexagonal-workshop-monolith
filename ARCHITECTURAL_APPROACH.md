# Architectural Approach for Conference Management System

## Core Architectural Principles

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Our system is built on DDD principles to ensure the software model aligns with business needs:

- **Ubiquitous Language**: We maintain a consistent vocabulary across all bounded contexts
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clearly defined boundaries between different parts of the system
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that represent descriptive aspects of the domain
- **Domain Events**: Capture occurrences of significance in the domain
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Translates between different models when integrating with external systems

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
This architecture style enables the separation of concerns:

- **Domain Core**: Contains business logic isolated from external concerns
- **Ports**: Define interfaces that the application exposes or consumes
- **Adapters**: Implement the interfaces defined by ports to connect with external systems
- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies always point inward, with the domain at the center

## Standard Layer Structure

### 1. Domain Layer
The heart of the application containing the business logic:

- **Aggregates**: Define transaction boundaries and consistency rules
- **Entities**: Objects with identity and lifecycle
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects defined by their attributes
- **Domain Services**: Stateless operations that don't naturally belong to entities
- **Domain Events**: Notifications of significant occurrences in the domain
- **Repositories (interfaces)**: Define how to access and persist aggregates

### 2. Application Layer
Orchestrates the use cases of the application:

- **Commands/Queries**: Represent user intentions
- **Command/Query Handlers**: Execute the business logic for specific commands/queries
- **Application Services**: Coordinate domain objects to perform tasks
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for communication with external layers

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
Provides technical capabilities and adapters:

- **Persistence**: Database implementations of repositories
- **API Endpoints**: REST, GraphQL, or other interfaces
- **Event Publishers/Subscribers**: Messaging infrastructure
- **External Service Clients**: Integration with third-party services

### 4. Anti-Corruption Layer
Translates between different models:

- **Translators**: Convert between external models and domain models
- **Facades**: Simplify complex external systems
- **Adapters**: Connect to external systems while protecting the domain model

## Implementation Guidelines

### Package Structure
For each bounded context:
```
com.conference.[boundedcontext]
  ├── api                 # DTOs, Commands, Queries
  ├── domain              # Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services
  │   ├── aggregates
  │   ├── valueobjects
  │   └── services
  ├── application         # Application Services, Command/Query Handlers
  ├── infrastructure      # Technical implementations
  │   ├── persistence
  │   ├── messaging
  │   └── rest
  └── anticorruption      # Integration with external systems
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Aggregates**: Named after domain concepts (e.g., `Attendee`, `Session`)
- **Value Objects**: Named after the concept they represent (e.g., `Email`, `Address`)
- **Commands**: Verb + Noun + Command (e.g., `RegisterAttendeeCommand`)
- **Events**: Noun + Past Participle + Event (e.g., `AttendeeRegisteredEvent`)
- **Repositories**: Aggregate name + Repository (e.g., `AttendeeRepository`)

### Testing Strategy
- **Domain Layer**: Unit tests for business rules
- **Application Layer**: Integration tests for use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Integration tests for technical implementations
- **End-to-End**: Tests that verify complete user journeys

## Technology Recommendations

- **Framework**: Quarkus for cloud-native Java applications
- **Persistence**: JPA/Hibernate with Panache for simplified data access
- **API**: JAX-RS for REST endpoints
- **Messaging**: Reactive messaging for event-driven architecture
- **Containerization**: Docker with OpenShift deployment
- **Build Tool**: Maven for dependency management and build automation

## Evolution and Maintenance

- **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document significant architectural decisions
- **Context Mapping**: Maintain documentation of relationships between bounded contexts
- **Refactoring**: Continuously refine the model as domain understanding evolves
- **Technical Debt**: Regularly address technical debt to maintain system quality

## Integration Patterns

- **Synchronous Communication**: REST APIs for direct integration
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Event-based integration for loose coupling
- **Shared Kernel**: Carefully managed shared code between bounded contexts
- **Customer/Supplier**: Establish upstream/downstream relationships between teams
- **Conformist**: Adapt to external models when necessary
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Protect domain model integrity when integrating

By following these architectural principles and patterns consistently across all parts of the system, we ensure a cohesive, maintainable, and scalable application that accurately reflects the business domain.
